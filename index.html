                <h3>Web Servers</h3>
                <p>
                    <!-- Explain the concept of a designated home page and how its name relates to different servers and languages. -->
                    A designated <strong>homepage</strong> is what is referred to as the file in the root directory that is
                    referenced as the default file to return whenever a GET request is initiated for the "/" request on a web-server.
                    The "/" request is typically mapped to the file name "/index.html". The Apache web-server, which OSU Engineering uses for their server software,
                    uses this standard.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    <!-- Explain what can be seen in the browser's Web Dev/Inspector Network tab output screen (use the concepts provided in the Exploration). What is different about the file's details when viewed from the web server versus the local computer? -->
                    The <strong>Web Dev/Inspector Network tab</strong> provides useful insights into how the web page is accessed and retrieved.
                    The <strong>status code</strong> upon inspection of the file for both local and web-server access has a value of 200. 
                    Codes ranging from 200-299 indicate successful responses, and the code of 200 specifically indicates that the response body has all the necessary information.
                    The <strong>request methods</strong> between both local and server-side access can be seen as "GET". This indicates that we are requesting to receive the data from the source, be it local or from the web server.
                    The <strong>types</strong> displayed for both local and server-side files display a content type of "text/html". This indicates that the content received is simple text with HTML language.
                    The <strong>URL (Uniform Resource Locator)</strong> for the local file is, as expected, different from that of the server-side's URL. The local URL is the path to the local file on the machine. For example, my Macbook machine starts with "/users" and ends with the "/M4/a4-grinne/index.html".
                    The URL from the web-server is much different and instead starts with "web.engr.oregonstate.edu", which is the OSU web server website that hosts a student's site.
                    The <strong>ports</strong> also differ between local and server-side inspection. On the local side, there is no port because we are not accessing information from the internet. On the server-side, the port is indicated as 443, which is the standard port for web pages that are encrypted with HTTPS.
                    The <strong>favicon</strong> name is only present when inspecting the web-server file, and represents the logo/icon that this OSU server automatically provides. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <!-- Explain why the favicon.ico file has a status 200, but the main.css and main.js files have a status 404 (or 400, if that is what you see). -->
                    The <strong>favicon.ico</strong> file has a status of 200 because the file is automatically provided within this OSU web-server. The main.css and main.js files have a status code of 404 because although these are referenced in the HTML code, the web-server does not provide these services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <!-- Explain the parts of your web server's URL. What are the scheme, the subdomains, the host domain, and the resources? -->
                    The <strong>URL</strong> of an internet address contains several parts. We will go through each part of the URL where this file resides, at https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~grinne/a4-grinne/.
                    The <strong>scheme</strong> is the protocol the web client uses to request the resource. For this file, it is HTTPS.
                    The <strong>server name (domain)</strong> is the name of the machine where the IP address of the file is hosted. In this case it is "oregonstate.edu".
                    The <strong>subdomain</strong> is the prefix to the domain name and is a subsection of that domain. Here, it is "web.engr".
                    The <strong>port on the server</strong> is the port on the machine where the data is transmitted. The standard port number for HTTPS is 443, and so it is omitted from the URL.
                    The <strong>path to resource</strong> is the path from the server to the requested destination/file. In this case, it is "~grinne/a4-grinne/". Note the final "/", which is mapped to "index.html" as mentioned when discussing homepages.
                    The <strong>item on the page (or fragment)</strong> is not present in this URL. If present, this would indicate the part of the page to locate (or scroll to) and display.
                    <strong>Query parameters</strong> are also not present within the URL, as we are not requesting specified filtering of additional data.

                <h3>Frontend Design</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Frontend design</strong> involves creating an appropriate user interface and experience on the web. It includes designing appropriate visuals on the page, the graphical user-interface (GUI),
                     and the overall interactive experience. Visual design should have a consistent color scheme, font and typography scheme, a photography, icon, and illustration scheme, and navigation systems that make sense.

                <p><strong>Page Layout Tags:</strong> The <strong>&lt;header&gt;</strong> tag is used as the banner of the site, and is typically the same across pages/links.
                     The <strong>&lt;main&gt;</strong> tag holds the primary content of the webpage.
                     The <strong>&lt;section&gt;</strong> tag defines sections, and can be used to group content together.
                     The <strong>&lt;article&gt;</strong> tag is usually used within a section, and holds a specific topic within that section.
                     The <strong>&lt;footer&gt;</strong> tag is placed after the closing main tag and contain legal/contact information, and links to important pages. 
                     The <strong>&lt;nav&gt;</strong> tag defines a set of navigation links to different pages.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>External links</strong>: Anchors link to an external URL using the 'href' attribute. For example: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN's Developer Website</a></li>
                    <li><strong>Internal links</strong>: Anchors link to internal content from one text item to another text item within the same page, by using IDs. For example: <a href="#webServers">Go to the Web Server</a></li>
                    <li><strong>Page-to-page links</strong>: Anchors link to other pages within the same website using a relative URL. For example: <a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>

                <h3>Favicons</h3>
                <p>
                    Favicons can be thought of as logos that represent the company, app, or general brand being displayed. They can be GIF, PNG, ICO, or SVG file formats. 
                    The favicon symbol image is tested as different file formats so that it works on multiple browsers/devices. Then, when the browser has access to the symbol, it will use that symbol in places such as a tab, app logo, search engine results, bookmarks, etc.
                    Modern techniques to accomodate several devices have a higher quality favicon and a lower quality one, so that the appropriate image can be used in places that will allow each. For example, a high quality favicon should be used with an app logo, while a lower quality favicon could be present in the browser tab.
